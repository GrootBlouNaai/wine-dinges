05.03.19 v1.2:
	* Script now accepts additional arguments as arguments for the application
		executable. For example, for launching the game with -opengl -nodx
		arguments launch the script with the same arguments:
		./start.sh -opengl -nodx
	* Added the ability to use winetricks in tools.sh script
	* Added the ability to use winetricks for installing components and
		applying tweaks during prefix creation. Add components/tweaks names
		into game_info/winetricks_list.txt file and winetricks will automatically
		install them. Winetricks itself will be downloaded by script automatically
		if it's not installed.
		More info in game_info/readme_en.txt file.
	* Script now uses XDG_CACHE_HOME directory for storing cache directory
		near itself. This directory is used for storing fonts caches, shader
		caches, etc. And it's also used for
		files that winetricks downloads.
	* Cache and log files of DXVK now stores in cache/dxvk directory.
	* Most variable from settings_SCRIPTNAME file are renamed to be more
		meaningful.
	* Script now output more useful information during prefix creation
		and hides useless information.
	* Script output redirection to different file removed as it
		breaks some games (For example, The Sims 4)
	* Resolution restoration is now correctly works with multi-monitor
		configurations (thanks to guys from RuTracker).
	* Using of game_info/additional directory is changed and simplified.
		It now uses directories that match the real one.
		More info in game_info/readme_en.txt file.
	* File descriptors limit rises to 500k when ESYNC is enabled, because
		the old 100k isn't enough for some games.
	* GLIBC version checking is added back.
	* Documentation updated.
	* Some additional fixes and impovements.
=======================================================================
14.03.19 v1.2.1:

=======================================================================
15.03.19 v1.2.2:
	* Fixed GLIBC version checking, it now correctly works in different
		Linux distros and it correctly works with versions with two
		dots in output (like 2.14.1)
	* Added two variables to control GLIBC checking: one for disabling
		version checking and another for changing required version
	* Added using of wine-development if it's available when using system Wine
	* Added architecture checking for prefix and Wine, if they are not match
		script will warn you and exit.

		the ability to disable dll using the variable)
	* Removed the --debug launch parameter, ENABLE_DEBUG variable replaces
		it now
	* The functions of the tools.sh script have been merged into the start.sh
		script
	* ProgramData directory now moves outside the prefix into the documents
		directory, because some games store their saves and settings in it
	* Added the ability to set custom path to the documents directory
	* Added the ability to enable NTFS_MODE for the cases when a user
		have problems running a game on NTFS filesystem
	* .temp_files directory renamed to temp_files (without a dot, so is not hidden now)
	* Some other improvements

    * Fixed a bug with NTFS_MODE
=======================================================================
19.01.21 v1.3.2:

		of renaming them (REMOVE_OLD_PREFIXES variable)
	* Added error handling during the prefix initialization
	* Improved handling of the script launch arguments
	* Enabled the Wine prefix recreation when content of the game_info directory
		changes
	* Added variable VIRTUAL_DESKTOP_SIZE
=======================================================================
19.01.21 v1.3.3:
	* Variables NICE_LEVEL and STAGING_RT_PRIORITY_SERVER are disabled by
		default now
=======================================================================
26.01.21 v1.3.4:
	* Added the "--fm" launch parameter to run Wine file manager.
	* Restored the "--debug" launch parameter to show more information
		when running Wine. You can now use both the ENABLE_DEBUG variable
		and this launch parameter, depending on what is more convenient for you.
	* Restored and fixed the function for restoring screen resolution after
		exiting Wine.
	* Fixed the Documents_Multilocale directory usage for Proton.
=======================================================================

	* Fixed hang when creating a prefix on some systems
		(https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51086)
	* Added winetricks dependecy check
	* A separate directory is now used for the winetricks download cache
	* Added more environment variables
=======================================================================
05.09.21 v1.3.6:
	* The fix for hangs when creating a prefix is disabled by default
		now, because it causes issues with video playback in some games.
		It can be enabled with the PREFIX_HANG_FIX environment variable.
=======================================================================
05.09.21 v1.3.7:
	* Added the --shortcuts launch argument to add shortcuts to launch the script
		on the desktop and the applications menu

	* Removed 7z and xz from the winetricks dependency check
=======================================================================
07.08.22 v1.3.10:
	* Added USE_BUILTIN_VKD3D environemnt variable, which enabled the usage
		of Wine's builtin VKD3D instead of VKD3D-proton
	* When creating a prefix, wineboot output is now saved to temp_files/wineboot.log
	* When creating a prefix, system information is now saved to temp_files/sysinfo
	* If a game or Wine crashes or fails to launch, debug mode is automatically
		enabled for the next run of the script
	* Scripts now automatically unsets the SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable
		to avoid problems with Windows games that use SDL
	* Some other small fixes and improvements
=======================================================================
21.10.23 v1.3.11:
	* Launch argument "--clean" renamed to "--clear"
	* Added new environment variables from Proton, DXVK and vkd3d-proton
	* RESTORE_RESOLUTION disabled by default, because it was setting
		the refresh rate incorrectly on some systems.
	* The script now automatically enables NTFS_MODE if Wine fails to
		create prefix and if the script detect that a game is stored
		on NTFS, exFAT or FAT partition. NTFS_MODE is also automatically
		enabled if there is no write permission on the directory where
		the script resides.
	* If system has a higher file descriptors limit than specified in the
		script, the script uses the system limit.
	* The script takes into account translated names of the desktop
		directory when creating desktop files.
	* The script now show information about the system when debug mode
		is enabled.
	* The script now takes into account syswow64 and system32 directories
		in game_info/dlls. For example, if you want the script to copy
		libraries into windows/syswow64, you need to put them into
		game_info/dlls/syswow64 directory. You can still simply put them
		into the root of game_info/dlls, in which case they will be copied
		to system32.
	* Removed some rarely used functions and features.
	* Added the ability to enable DLSS support on modern Nvidia GPUs.
		It can be enabled with ENABLE_RT_DLSS variable. Apart from
		enabling the env variable, you will also need to put nvapi64.dll
		(from dxvk-nvapi) into game_info/dlls. Of course, latest DXVK,
		vkd3d-proton and not very old videodrivers are also needed, and
		a game must support DLSS too.
	* Other minor improvements and bugfixes.

	* Disabled regsvr32 windows for new Wine versions
